Correlation Matrix:
	Pros:
		Good for identifying patterns between variables of a dataset
		Can uncover hidden relationships between variables
	Cons:
		Can't visualize or display detailed relationships between individual data points
		Doesn't explain correlations

Scatterplot Matrix:
	Pros:
		Good for displaying general overview of dataset and showing patterns of correlation
		Finding outliers
	Cons:
		Limited to 2 variables per cell
		Identifying trends and correlation can be subjective

Parallel Coordinates:
	Pros:
		Good at displaying high dimensions of data
		Can show grouping of many datapoints in relation to each other
	Cons:
		Requires some preprocessing of data to determine axes location
		Could be difficult to read

PCA Plot:
	Pros:
		Good at showing similar data in clusters
		Increases readability of high dimension dataset
	Cons:
		Data needs to be preprocessed before creation
		Information is lost 

Biplot:
	Pros:
		Good at displaying high dimensional data
	Cons:
		Correlation between variables is not as obvious

MDS:
	Pros:
		Good at highlighting similarities/dissimilarities between datapoints
		Useful for mapping from differences
	Cons:
		Limited to a 2D/3D display of data
