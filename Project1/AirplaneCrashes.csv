Singer John Denver, 53, who was piloting the plane, was killed. Denver, an experienced pilot with over 2,800 flying hours, had only a little over an hour in the experimental plane. The accident was caused by the inadvertent application of right rudder by the pilot as he attempted to manipulate the fuel selector handle. The unmarked fuel selector handle in this aircraft was located in a hard to reach area behind the pilot's left shoulder, instead of between his legs. This required removing his harness and reaching behind. While turning around, he inadvertently pressed down on the plane's right rudder pedal causing the aircraft to roll and go into a dive.  Contributing factors were, Denver took off with too little fuel in one tank which led to the necessity of switching to his backup tank. Also it was difficult to determine how much fuel was in the tanks due to the unmarked fuel quantity sight gauge."

The airplane impacted upsloping terrain at a distance of about 1,100 meters from the runway and 40 m to the left of extended centerline. The immediate cause of the accident was the failure of the crew to make a timely decision to proceed to an alternate airport although they were not once timely informed of the actual weather conditions at Smolensk, which were significantly lower than the established airport minima. Descent without visual contact with ground references to an altitude much lower than minimum descent altitude for a go-around,  in order to establish visual flight.

Contributing to this accident was the engine core lock condition, which prevented at least one engine from being restarted, and the airplane flight manuals that did not communicate to pilots the importance of maintaining a minimum airspeed to keep the engine cores rotating."
